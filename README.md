# ![Logo](./src/icon48.png?raw=true) Web Search Navigator

![Demo flow](./assets/demo.gif?raw=true)

Simple browser extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to Google search™.
Google search™ used to provide experimental keyboard navigation, but it was [often broken](https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to have been [removed as of 2017-07-31](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).
In addition, I wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be
more vim like (j/k for navigation).

## Installation

Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-keyboard-navigat/cohamjploocgoejdfanacfgkhjkhdkek).

#### Installing from a release

1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/releases
1. Extract the zip file to any directory you'd like, though you need to make sure the directory is not deleted while you want to use the extension
1. Go to extensions page in Chrome (URL: `chrome://extensions`)
1. Enable developer mode if needed
1. Disable other existing instances of Google Search Navigator (from the store or from loading another unpacked version)

## Development

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager for dependency management and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for build.
Installing and building (deploying the web extension files) is as easy as:

```
yarn install && yarn build
```

The extension will be deployed directly to the `src` directory. You can load this directory as an unpacked extensions to
your browser.

_It would be better to deploy for example to `build/deploy` and add `gulp-watch` to update the deployed files
automatically. However when done so the browser's (Chrome) auto-reload extension gets broken and one has to reload the
extension manually on every change. Hence the `src` directory is used for the convenience._

## Build

To deploy the production sources use:

```
yarn build --production
```

The automated build scripts are currently not implemented so manual process is required afterward.

## TODO

*   Add option for navigating "Top stories"
