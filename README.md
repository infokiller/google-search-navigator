## Development

### Coding style

We use a coding style based on [Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) that is enforced with [eslint](https://eslint.org/). Please try to write your code in a similar style, and run eslint before sending a pull request.

### Building for development

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager for dependency management and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for building.
To build the extension for development run:

```sh
yarn install && yarn build
```

The extension will be deployed directly to the `src` directory.

The easiest way to run the built extension is to use `web-ext` which will run a separate it in a separate browser profile. From the project root directory:

```sh
# Replace '--target chromium' with "--target firefox-desktop" for Firefox.
yarn run web-ext run --source-dir src --start-url 'https://www.google.com/search?q=whatever' --target chromium
```

Alternatively, you can load this directory as an unpacked extensions to your browser.

_It would be better to deploy for example to `build/deploy` and add `gulp-watch` to update the deployed files
automatically. However when done so the browser's (Chrome) auto-reload extension gets broken and one has to reload the
extension manually on every change. Hence the `src` directory is used for the convenience._

### Building a release

To build a bundle consumable by the browser with minified dependencies:

```sh
# Replace make-chrome.sh with make-firefox.sh for Firefox
yarn install && yarn build --env production && ./tools/make-chrome.sh
```

Then, upload the bundle to the browser store from `./build/chrome/package.zip`/`./build/firefox/package.zip`.

### Adding a new search engine

See a [reference commit with minimal changes for amazon.com](https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/commit/f57a7e4aedf66d8395995671ef4f18f3e93333b0). Specific steps:

- Add the required URLs to the `optional_permissions` key in [`src/manifest.json`](./src/manifest.json)
- Add a checkbox for enabling it to [`src/options_page.html`](./src/options_page.html) (copy an existing one and modify it)
- Add code to [`src/options_page.js`](./src/options_page.js) for handling the permission request
- Add a new class to [`src/search_engines.js`](./src/search_engines.js) with the required properties. See the documentation at the top of the file and use the other search engines classes in that file as a reference.
- Add a class instance to [`searchEngines`](https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/blob/60d64947b07381e0be61df657c4de4a85ccfc2a7/src/search_engines.js#L542).
