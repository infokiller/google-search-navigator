New is 0.2.91:
* Changed keyboard handling to Mousetrap
* Added keybindings for time filtering, relevance sorting

New in 0.2.9:
The issue is related to a new feature for opening a search result in the background- see the discussion in https://github.com/infokiller/google-search-navigator/issues/53
* Removed tabs permission which caused a scary Chrome warning about a new
  permission in the extension to read "browsing history".
  Note from author: sorry for that warning, but I can assure you that this extension DOES NOT READ ANY of your browsing history. You don't need to trust my word- you can read the source code in https://github.com/infokiller/google-search-navigator

New in 0.2.8:
* Changed default key binding of "Open selected result in new window/tab" to `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + Enter/Space`.
* New feature for Navigation to a new tab in background (Ctrl/⌘ + Enter/Space)
* New keybindings for navigating between search result pages
* Added navigation to more tabs: shopping, books, flights, and financial.

New in 0.2.5:
* Keybindings for navigating to images/videos/maps/news tabs
* Works in encrypted.google.com

Simple open source extension that enhances the keyboard navigation
in Google Search. Google used to provide an experimental keyboard navigation for
search results, but it was often broken (https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to
have been removed as of 2017-07-31 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).
In addition, I wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be
more vim like (j/k for navigation).
